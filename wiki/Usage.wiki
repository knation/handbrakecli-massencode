USAGE: massencode -i SOURCE -f FORMAT --params PARAMS \options\

==Required==

  _-i, --input PATH_      The directory to search for DVD files.

  _-f, --format TYPE_     The format of the output files. (avi,mp4,ogm,mkv)

  _--params PARAMS_       Handbrake CLI command parameter/values to use,
                          EXCLUDING -i, -o, -f (Surround in quotes).

==Optional==

  _-o, --output PATH_     The directory to save output files to
                        (Default: Location of DVD Files).

  _--hcli FILE_           The location of Handbrake CLI

                        (Default: C:\Program Files\Handbrake\HandBrakeCLI.exe).

  _-R_                    Recursively go through each folder looking for DVDs.

  _-D_                    Delete the original DVD files upon successful encoding.

  _-p, --pause MMSS:MMSS_ Pauses the script during the time frame specified. Accepts a  
                          comma separated list of time frames for which to pause the
                          script. *NOTE:* Start and end times are assumed to be within
                          the same day, so the end time must be a greater number than
                          the start time. Also, this means that this script currently
                          _does not_ support pausing between days (from 11p-1a the next
                          morning, for example).

  _-v, --verbose_         Enables verbose logging.

  _-l, --log_             Logs all output to the specified file.

  _--force_               If the output file already exists, overwrite it.

  _--logbuffer BYTES_     The number of bytes to keep in memory before writing to 
                          the log. Default: 256000. Exception: Log will always be written
                          after encoding a file.

  _--test_                Functions the same without actually encoding anything. Shows
                          what all output and Handbrake CLI commands would look like.

  _-h, --help_            Prints this usage information.
